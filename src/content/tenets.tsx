        <p>
            Universal Design posits that the idea of "accessible design" falls short
            of the goalpost. Accessibility should not be an afterthought or
            specialty role of a developer, but should be a goal from the starting
            point of a website's design. It's main point being that accessible
            design is <em>good</em> design.
